# nanteq_deepeye
This project released during Ciphrovoy Proriv 2019. Utilizing YOLO along with special markers, we detect anomalies on static open IP cameras.

# Run project
To run this project on video use:
```bash
./run_video.sh video/0.mp4
```
Now you can play (actually receive the stream) video using:

```bash
./play_streetstream.sh
```
To produce masks use third-party software like GIMP.
